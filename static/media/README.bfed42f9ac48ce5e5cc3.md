This book is one of the sources of inspiration for this site. I've decided to organize this site based off of way the author categorizes charts - by the types of data certain charts represent best.

### Content
There is very little published content for this section but I wanted to include it somewhere since I think this is an excellent source for learning about the various concepts behind data visualization.

I learned R and ggplot2 by attempting to create the charts shown in the book and only included a few polished ones for public viewing.
