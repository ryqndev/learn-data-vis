# Data Vis Cheatsheet

## What is this?
Data Vis Cheatsheet is a repository containing source code that generates various charts. I plan to support at least 2 languages: R (with ggplot2) and JS (with visx) for every chart. 


## Who does this help?
For UCI students, this site tries to implement every chart found in the textbook for INF-143 with plans to support other textbooks as well.
