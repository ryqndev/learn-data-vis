# Data Vis Reference



### What is this?
Data Vis Reference is a repository containing source code that generates various charts. I plan to support at least 2 languages: **[R - with ggplot2]** and **[Javascript - with visx]** for every chart.

### Who does this help?
Anyone interested in learning how to use R's tidyverse package to create visualizations. Since there's a lack of examples in documentation (I think every doc should have examples, really), hopefully this site will help developers pick up R in a more example-oriented manner.

#### Generated Dark Mode Charts
All generated charts (like those made in R) have CSS filters applied to them, rather than generating a dark mode version for them so keep that in mind when you look at the source code and realize the colors don't match up.

#### Mobile??
Plans to support mobile/smaller screens (width < 1400px) are underway, just not a priority at the moment.

#### Legal 
All code and generated charts are written by myself and are never taken directly from an external source. The purpose of this site is to teach how one *could* code a certain type of chart or diagram, whereas the source material for some charts likely only intends to show the chart for its content and the design itself - thus being transformative in nature. Similarly, this site is purely **educational**, **non-commercial**, and **transformative** - qualifying for **Fair Use**. Furthermore, all sources will have full attribution and credit if it exists to the best of my knowledge. 

With that in mind, if you have issues if you think your content is not attributed correctly or want something taken down, feel free to let me know through any of my contact options found on the bottom of this site.
