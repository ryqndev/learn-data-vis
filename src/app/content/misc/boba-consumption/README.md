# Boba Consumption by Time

#### What is this?
This is a heatmap of the number of drinks I've purchased with respect to time. (~2 years worth of data)

#### Conclusions

Most of the drinks recorded are coffee drinks that I buy at the start of the day, hence the high count of purchases when my local Starbucks shop opens **@5:30AM**

#### Obvious self plug

This data was recorded and downloaded through an app I developed called **[Boba Watch](https://boba.watch)**.

**note:** Since this is an assignment for class, the source code will be hidden for now.
